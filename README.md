## Angular 2 & TypeScript

In it's current form, this is a "Hello, World!" for Angular 2 and TypeScript. It contains a component, added some libraries from node_modules, and launched it with a static file server using lite-server.

### Quickstart

* Clone the repository
* run `npm install`
* run `npm start`

Your browser should open up a localhost with the title! This has a live reloader / transpiler, so you can make HTML changes inside of app.component.ts and see your changes in the browser automatically.
